# nice to meet you

I’m Kire (kee-day), a developer with a heart for people and problem-solving.

At Idaho National Laboratory (INL), I help guide the migration of several public-facing websites from SharePoint to WordPress. I keep our Jira boards on track, work closely with cross-functional teams, and contribute directly to site builds — all while making sure we meet federal standards for security, performance, and accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA). I also bring in automation, analytics, and smart redirect strategies to create a smoother, more user-friendly experience.

Before INL, I worked as a freelance web developer (2017–2020), creating custom sites for organizations and individual creatives. I was hands-on with everything from design and development to hosting, SEO, accessibility, and database migrations with SQL. From 2020–2023, I shifted into healthcare, working as an emergency room technician at a local hospital. There, I not only helped care for patients but also took on people-centered roles, like serving on the retention and recruitment committee and coordinating the nurse education program. I built and delivered curriculum, taught clinical terminology in English, trained nurses on the floor, and helped hire for the float pool.

My non-tech background helps me bring a people-first perspective to development. When my time at INL ends, I’m excited to find a company that values that.
